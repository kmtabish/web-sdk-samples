# Disable Analytics Tracking

Sample project demonstrating the integration of Localytics web-sdk with the `disableAnalyticsTracking` option. This will prevent the upload of events and sessions for users that you'd rather not be tracking, such as logged out users (this example does this), or users that are in a certain market segment you wish to ignore, and don't want to generate data points for them.

## Running Code

#### In `index.html`, replace `YOUR-LOCALYTICS-APP-KEY` with your Localytics app key.

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm install`

then

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
